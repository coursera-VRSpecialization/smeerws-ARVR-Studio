# AR/VR Art|Design|Development Studio

### Project description: 
This project is part of the coursera course 3D Models for Virtual Reality.
It showcases several facets of my work with Virtual Realtiy (VR).  
In a factory environmnent you will experience VR artwork I've made with VR Software, such as, Tilt Brush, Quill, Medium, 
Blocks etc. Furthermore, traditional videos made based on VR artwork, and development work I've done in this field with Unity.   

### Development platform: 
Windows 10, Unity 2019.1.14f1, 
Visual Studio community 2017 version 15.9.17, SteamVR Plugin 2.5.0 (sdk 1.8.19), 
Scripting Runtime Version: .NET 4.x Equivalent

### Target platform: 
Oculus Rift S/Rift/Vive

### Visuals: 
First sketch:

First screenshot MainScene:

### Necessary setup/execution steps: 
In general, you need Unity, SteamVR Plugin (imported and installed), a Rift/Vive/Rift S.
Clone the project, run the project Assets > MyGame > Scenes > MainScene.

All Plugins are in this project. If there are issues with SteamVR, delete the Plugin in the project and reimport and install it from the Unity Asset Store. 

### Third party material: 
* The used factory environmnent in this project I've used in another project before: 
  - https://github.com/smeerws/VRND-NightattheMuseum
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S7aneXMAQU&feature=emb_title

  In this project I restructured and renamed the GameObjects in the Hierarchy to make the project cleaner.

### Project state: 
Idea generation (Done), basic model factory building (Done), whiteboxing (Done), SteamVR import (WiP), Locomotion-teleportation (Wip) 

### Limitations:
The AR work is not part of this project yet. 
Teleport area isn't accurate yet, it is possible to teleport into walls. 
Open issues: SteamVR resize/scale player results in hands offset. 

### Lessons Learned: 

* Install Unity
* Create a Unity 3D project
* Build a Scene with 3D Objects
* Import SteamVR
* Implement locomotion in Unity with SteamVR
